###### Details about Lab 1

*Part 1*
Part 1 calculates and plots any arbitrary polynomial function, y(x). The function takes two arguments: the coefficients of the function, and the range over which the function is plotted.
> Ex: if input is [1,4,0,2], linspace(-1,1,100) then part 1 will plot the function x^3 + 4x^2 + 2 from [-1,1], and will also plot the individual terms y= x^3, 4x^2, and 2.
Write your own function that will calculate and plot any arbitrary polynomial function 𝑦(𝑥). Your
function should have the following characteristics:
*Part 2*
Part 2 can calculate the integral using the Riemann Sum definition. It takes in as an input the bounds of integration. Currently, the function being executed (in line 11) is y=2x, so the integral should be x^2.
>Ex: if input is [0;2], then the integral would be 3.
